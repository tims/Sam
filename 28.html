    <p>You call the kennel Sam was in and yell at them for re-homing an aggressive dying dog. You insist that you can&#39;t live with him and arrange for them to take him back. Sam is not re-homed again, although the kennel tries. Back in the kennel, he becomes even more depressed and quickly loses weight again before dying that winter. But at least you didn&#39;t kill him..</p>
