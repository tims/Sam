Sam's last days.

Sam goes wild. Not such a good outcome.
Sam goes back to the kennel and dies of starvation. Bad outcome.
Sam gets put down by a vet. This is the best outcome.
Sam bites your hand off. You pass out from the blood loss and bleed to death. There is no epilogue explaining what happened to Sam, because you are dead, you cannot know…

Merry Christmas. That is all.

You let Sam sleep at the foot of your bed. In the middle of the night you roll over and accidentally disturb him, every morning for the rest of your life you look in the mirror and the scar down your cheek reminds you to let sleeping dogs lie.


How do you feed Sam?

Feed Sam only the best!
* Ham, cooked Turkey mince. He loves eating it, but never eats the same thing in a row?

Fatten him up!
* Bread and peanut butter.

Feed Sam dog food.
* Dried dog food. :(
* Tinned dog food. :( :( Your house now stinks.


Where does Sam sleep?
* On your bed with you in the lounge room? (This is bad for your own health. If you do this too much, you become emaciated and begin biting strangers).
* On the bed with you. (if you do this he bites you in the middle of the night and you are permanently disfigured)
* In the bathroom on the floor? (he likes this, but gets lonely)
* On the sofa bed in the lounge room? (he doesn't like this, but it's better than the floor)
* On the floor in the lounge room? (he doesn't like this, but tolerates it)


Where do you take Sam for a walk? (Sam loves walks)
* To the market. (he freaks out).
* To the cafe. (He enjoys the walk but tries to attack a jack russel)
* To the park. (He enjoys parks, he eventually attacks a corgi)
* To the other park. (He enjoys parks)

If you take Sam for too many walks before opting for a muzzle he will bites a middle class kid.

What do you do with Sam in the evenings?
* Let him sleep in your bedroom? (This is his preference, if you do this you have to get him off your bed afterwards, he will bite you).
* Let him sleep in the bathroom. (He likes this, but will get lonely).
* Let him sleep at your feet while you watch things on iPlayer in the lounge room.

There are a couple of ways to end the game early.
* If you don't muzzle Sam, you will be arrested and the game will be over.
* You could abandon him. He will turn into a myth that eats babies and stray poodles. You will go to hell.


There are three possible proper endings:

After 2 weeks. You have to make a choice… 

Live with him until he dies? (You will be ostracised from civilisation for a year before he dies of natural causes, if you are not already scarred, you will be). You earn a bottle of absinthe.

Take him back to the kennel? (You "do the right thing" and let the professionals handle him. They let him die lonely and painfully in the kennel). You earn a £65 bottle of port that tastes like urine, but you feel much more middle class for it.

Take him to the vet and get him put down? (It's a tough choice, he dies relatively peacefully. You feel guilty for a while, but your house is now clean and you have put and end to the menace). You earn 2 bottles of gin.


So the game has the following structure.
You must feed Sam.
You must walk Sam.
You must decide where Sam sleeps.
You must decide what to do with Sam in the evenings.

Every morning Sam will tell you what he thinks of you. His happiness is reserved for mornings.
The game is a series of choices.
