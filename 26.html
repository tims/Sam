    <p>This pattern continues for a couple of weeks. Sam is still sad and in pain. He isn&#39;t so deathly skinny, but he is getting more aggressive towards other dogs. He snaps at you a couple more times, but you learn to never touch him when he&#39;s lying down, or tired. He still enjoys his walks, even though he loathes his muzzle, but he doesn&#39;t seem to find it any easier going up stairs and his limp seems worse. Sometimes in the mornings you feel like Sam loves you, but also that he may mistake your hand for a rabbit. It becomes apparent that Sam was probably a hunting dog, he has never been a pet before and is unable to adjust to it. Eventually you must decide Sam&#39;s fate.</p>
