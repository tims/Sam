    <p>This was just the beginning. It quickly becomes the norm for Sam to have your bed. You lose all your friends and your own self respect. It&#39;s not long before you are eating tinned dog food. Sam comes out every morning and looks you in the eye. You can feel it.. He pities you. He shakes his head slowly and heads back to your old bed. You whine quietly for a while before throwing yourself off the balcony.</p>

      <p>Merry Christmas! You have earned 3 lumps of coal and a bottle of gin.
