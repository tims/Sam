    <p>You are standing in a park. There is is a thin layer of snow covering everything.
You arrived here to meet a rescue dog. He is an 11 year old lurcher named Sam. He&#39;s been in a kennel for the last 3 years. The kennel told you he was whippet size, but he&#39;s actually the size of a greyhound. He looks emaciated, his ribs and spine are clearly visible. Even so, he is a beautiful dog. He is sniffing the ground and doesn&#39;t seem to have noticed you yet.
