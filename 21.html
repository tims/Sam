    <p>You really don&#39;t like muzzles then? Hmm. On your next walk Sam bites a kid, badly. He rips his eye out and the kid loses lots of blood. The kid dies during reconstructive surgery due to complications. You get sent to jail and Sam gets promptly shot. You never quite recover from your time inside and as soon as you get out you resort to crime. You enter a spiral of petty crime, prison and drug abuse and die of a heroin overdose 2 years later.</p>
