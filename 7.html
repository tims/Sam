    <p>Sam doesn&#39;t seem to be putting up much of a fight, he walks unsteadily as you pull him towards the car. He very reluctantly clambers into the back seat. On the way home he keeps falling off the seat and snaps at you if you try to help him. Eventually you introduce him to his new house. He walks unsteadily into the middle of the lounge room, there is already a dog bed made up for him.</p>
