    <p>You have put lots and lots of thought into it. You spend the whole of one last lovely day with Sam. You feed him lots of ham and stay with him the whole day. He wags his tail more than he has any day previously. In the morning you remind yourself about everything that brought you to this decision.
You take Sam for one last walk to the vet and feed him bacon while explaining everything to them. They agree with your decision to put him down, especially after trying to sedate him and he tries to rip the throat out of the assistant nurse (with the muzzle on). It&#39;s heartbreaking to watch him try to sit down as the sedative takes effect, but soon it&#39;s all over. Sam dies as painlessly as possible.</p>
