    <p>A couple of friends come over to meet him. They adore and pity his beautiful, but emaciated frame. Everyone is respectful around him. Sam greets them and accepts dog biscuits and schmackos. Later he is laying on the carpet in the lounge room being patted when he begins to growl. Everyone backs away from him. Sam goes into your bedroom and stands by your bed looking at it.</p>
