    <p>You take Sam out again, this time along the canal. There&#39;s a strange moment where he seems friendly towards another dog, a border collie, the collie gets close and they are sniffing each other when suddenly Sam lunges at her with teeth bared. He tries to grab her by the neck, but you pull him back just in time. You take him home quickly. Soon Sam needs another walk.</p>
